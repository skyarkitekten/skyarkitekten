# Hi there, I'm Chad (skyarkitekten) 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m passionate about innovation, transformation, and building robust, scalable distributed systems.

## 🚀 Current Role
I am a Distinguished Engineer at Neudesic, an IBM Company. My focus is on building innovative solutions with emerging technologies, especially in the areas of AI, agentic applications, and edge computing.

I spend a lot of time working on agentic software engineering (SWE) and agnetic site reliability engineering (SRE). For what it's worth, I’m not a fan of the term “vibe coding”—it tends to overlook the real engineering skills needed to create something valuable and lasting.

## 🛠️ Areas of Expertise
- **Software Engineering**
- **Systems Design**
- **Cloud Architecture (Azure, AWS)**
- **DevOps & GitOps (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, CI/CD)**
- **Automation & Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Bicep, ARM)**

## 🔬 Current Research & Interests
These days, I’m especially interested in:
- **AI and Agentic Applications**
- **Edge Computing**
- **Advanced Kubernetes security and governance**
- **Modern approaches to infrastructure resilience**
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) for large-scale cloud solutions**
- **AI/ML integrations in cloud-native platforms**

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: leading innovation and building AI Engineering teams.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: AI on Azure.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with: building and growing innovative teams.
- 💬 Ask me about: Digital and Application Innovation, AI Engineering, Bourbon, Sourdough, Ohio State Football

## 📫 Let’s Connect!
You can find me here on GitHub, or reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadcthomas/)) (if you’d like this included).

I don't do social meadia, and neither should you.

Thanks for stopping by!
